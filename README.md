# Green Thumbs
A website to learn about gardening and talk to your fellow Australians for best gardening practice! 

## Description

Green Thumbs is Australia's leading gardening community. Whether you're new in the garden or a seasoned veteran, our community is the place to share knowledge and find out what to plant next. 

This project was motivated by the all-too-common experience of walking out into the garden and seeing the your plants wilting or being eaten away by bugs. 

We wanted to crowdsource the knowledge of thousands of gardeners from across Australia and find out the best things to grow, at what time of year, and the tips to help them flourish.
